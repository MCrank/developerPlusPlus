# Part 1: Authentication

Requirements
* Make a new repo called developer-portal
* Use create-react-app to start a new react project
* Run through all the setup instructions outlined [HERE](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-3-data-driven-applications/chapters/react-setup.md)
* Add GITHUB authentication to your project.  See [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/github-auth) firebase document on authenticating with GitHub.
* Using the mockup below plan out what react components you think you are going to need for this application
* When a user is logged out they should see a navbar and a GitHub login button
* When a user is logged in they should see the navbar (with a logout button) and H2 tags outlining the main page components
